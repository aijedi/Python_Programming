    "A semaphore is a synchronization object that controls access by multiple processes/threads to a common resource in a parallel programming environment. It is simply a value in a designated place in operating system (or kernel) storage that each process/thread can check and then change. Depending on the value that is found, the process/thread can use the resource or will find that it is already in use and must wait for some period before trying again. Semaphores can be binary (0 or 1) or can have additional values. Typically, a process/thread using semaphores checks the value and then, if it using the resource, changes the value to reflect this so that subsequent semaphore users will know to wait."
